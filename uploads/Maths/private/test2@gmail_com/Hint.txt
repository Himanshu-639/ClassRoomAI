Named after a princess of myth, once chained by fate but now free among the stars.
Her story tells of fear and rescue, of monsters and heroes.
Though her feet once touched the sea, her name now shines in the night sky.
Echoes of her name can be found far beyond our world, a reminder of ancient tales.
What am I?
